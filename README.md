To help understand the relationship better the company wants the results presented in a chart and analyses the results.   
## The purpose of the report is
* To write a python code script in jupyter notebook that create a ride-sharing summary DataFrame , which includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
